add rel="subheader" type
 - option to show subheaders when filtering
 - option to place checkboxes in front of subheaders that will auto-check
   all child options... should be able to enable/disable per subheader

input box interaction
 - add current selections to input field upon selection
 - allow removal of items using input box
  - if user clicks on an item, it should be automatically selected
  - we will need to tightly manage how the input box interaction works,
    probably by constantly re-populating it and managing primarily via
    a backing object
